The server then redirects the client to /notes via GET request

THis causes the client to perform 3 more GET requests for the CSS, Javascript, and the data.json file. 

The server then runs the app.post method which creates a new note objects and adds/pushes the new note entry into the data.json file.

The client reloads the notes page with the current list of notes as well as their new note added as requested.
